## Overview

**arachNIDS-NG** is a local toolkit to manage, test, and deploy Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules. It eliminates the friction of managing raw rule files by using a structured **YAML-native format** that can be indexed, searched, and compiled into engine-specific syntax.

**Coming Soon:**
* Full schema specification for IDS rules.
* CLI tool for rule indexing and searching.
* Automated translation logic for Snort/Suricata. Designed for air-gapped environments. No telemetry, no cloud dependencies.
